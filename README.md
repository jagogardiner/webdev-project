# webdev-project

Assigned project code from Web Development and Databases module.

# Run project

Suggested:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run```

Can be ran outside of a virtual environment, however, will install lots of flask requirements to your system.

# Current to-do/bugs:
- Website does crash on /locations without MySQL connection to valid database
- Booking is not fully implemented
- Administrator dashboard is not implemented
- Member booking dashboard is not implemented
